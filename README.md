## Description of the assignment 

For my first challenge assignment, a marketing agency known as Horiseon has raised an on the job ticket and require skills within front-end and junior developers, to refactor an existing site and improve it by enabling it to become much more accessible.
Businesses are now in desperate need for web accessibility due to the fact that this new technology ensures that "people with disabilities have access to a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards". Implementing this new technology enables businesses to be better positioned in search engines like Google, and also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.


## Acceptance criteria

The aspects of web accessibility are crucial and highly beneficial for many people who unfortunately have disabillties and who may need the help using the horiseon website and many other different app users. To ensure that this is implemented, accessibility standards must be achieved.

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

* Heading attributes fall in sequential order

* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
